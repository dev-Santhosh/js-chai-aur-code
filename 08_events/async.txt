JavaScript is a Synchronous and Single threaded.
Execution context:
 executes one line of a code at a time
 each operation waits for the last operation to complete
 ex: console.log(1);
     console.log(2);
Blocking Code vs Non Blocking Code:
Blocking Code: Block the flow of the program
               Read file Synchronous
Non Blocking Code: Does not block execution of code
                   Read file async
